                the company</h2>
            <p>The perception of CSR is changing from philanthropy to sustainability.
                Shared responsibility and generosity for society have long been part of the
                Indian tradition. The culture continues at NCC, where Corporate Social
                Responsibility (CSR) is etched in the organizational DNA. It is therefore no
                surprise that at NCC, we continuously think of ways to give back to society
                from successful business endeavors towards community development. As
                part of CSR strategy, NCC undertakes a wide range of socio-economic,
                heathcare, skill development and educational initiatives under its CSR
                program touching the lives of the marginalized population.</p>
            <p> Our responsibility doesn’t end with mere thinking. NCC commits resources
                and effort.</p>
            <p>To ensure that CSR remains an ongoing activity and receives maximum
                attention, we set up NCC Foundation for our social and philanthropilc
                activities. With a wide range of socio-economic and educational initiatives,
                NCC Foundation was registered in Hyderabad in 2007 and registered with
                the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (Registration No. CSR00004366) in April
                2021. The aim of the Foundation is to work as a charitable organization and
                to bring about people centric development process.
